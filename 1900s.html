        John Fitzgerald-Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States (1961-1963), the youngest man elected to the office. On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, becoming also the youngest President to die in office. President Kennedy presided over Camelot, and was followed by Lyndon B. Johnson.
